## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profilepic.png" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is Giana Fontanetta, and I am a sophomore in the College of Engineering at Cornell Unversity. I plan to affiliate into Biological Engineering on the pre-med track and ultimately become a physician. I am interested specifically in pedatric nephrology and the intersection between engineering and medicine.

Take a look at <a href="{{ "/projects/" | relative_url }}">my projects</a> and <a href="{{ "/cv/" | relative_url }}">CV</a>.
