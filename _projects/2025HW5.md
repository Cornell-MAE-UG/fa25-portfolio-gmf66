As part of a homework assignment, I had to design a mechanism given a 2D design space of 150cm long and 50cm tall, a bar of fixed length, 3 pin supports, and a linear actuator to lift a maximum weight to the highest possible height, assuming all supports and the actuator are rigid. 
Here is my design: with dimensions, maximum possible load, and type of linear actuator.
