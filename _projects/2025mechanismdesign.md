As part of a homework assignment, I had to design a mechanism given a 2D design space of 150cm long and 50cm tall, a bar of fixed length, 3 pin supports, and a linear actuator to lift a maximum weight to the highest possible height, assuming all supports and the actuator are rigid. 




Considering the bar as rigid:
- Objectives: Design a mechanism within the given design space and constraints to lift a heavy weight to the maximum possible height.
- Static analysis:
- Final Design included in image

Considering the bar as not rigid:
- Maximum deflection assumptions:
- Final Design included in image
